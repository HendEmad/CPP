# why I use exception handling rather than using if conditions?
Exception handling is a powerful mechanism for writing robust and maintainable code. It allows you to separate the normal flow of your program from error handling code, and provides a way to propagate error information across multiple layers of the program.

Using `if` conditions to handle errors can quickly become cumbersome and error-prone, especially in complex programs with many possible error conditions. It can also lead to code duplication and make it harder to reason about the correct behavior of the program.

Here are some advantages of using exception handling over `if` conditions:

1. Separation of concerns: By using exception handling, you can separate the normal flow of your program from error handling code. This can make your code easier to read and maintain.

2. Centralized error handling: With exception handling, you can centralize your error handling code in one place, rather than scattering it throughout your program. This can make it easier to modify error handling behavior without affecting the rest of the code.

3. Better error reporting: Exceptions provide a way to propagate error information across multiple layers of the program. This can make it easier to understand the cause of an error and to take appropriate action.

4. More expressive: Exception handling allows you to write expressive code that focuses on the normal flow of the program, rather than error handling. This can make your code more readable and easier to understand.

Overall, exception handling is a powerful tool for writing robust and maintainable code, especially in complex programs with many possible error conditions.
